One of the most critical things, is needing to check community issues on latest develop branch (to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s not already fixed) everytime before funneling to product. So it was a lot of re-deploying every few days.
We do have a develop tagged docker image, but to actually be on the latest develop I&amp;rsquo;d need to re-pull it every once in a while, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help much.</description></item><item><title>Creating Shell Builtins</title><link>https://debdutdeb.github.io/blog/2022/06/creating-shell-builtins/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 15:31:59 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://debdutdeb.github.io/blog/2022/06/creating-shell-builtins/</guid><description>What are my goals for this article? Before writing this, I was thinking about it from the reader&amp;rsquo;s point of view, and it came to my attention that the goal of this article might get misinterpreted. So this section is to make sure that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen. My goal for this article, is very simple and straight forward. Following this, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a much better understanding of what shell builtins are, and why you should use them instead of general commands, whenever you can.</description></item></channel></rss>
