One of the most critical things, is needing to check community issues on latest develop branch (to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s not already fixed) everytime before funneling to product. So it was a lot of re-deploying every few days.
We do have a develop tagged docker image, but to actually be on the latest develop I&amp;rsquo;d need to re-pull it every once in a while, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help much.</description></item></channel></rss>
