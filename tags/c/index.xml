&lt;h1 id="what-are-my-goals-for-this-article"&gt;What are my goals for this article?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before writing this, I was thinking about it from the reader&amp;rsquo;s point of view, and it came to my attention that the goal of this article might get misinterpreted. So this section is to make sure that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen. My goal for this article, is very simple and straight forward. Following this, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a much better understanding of what shell &lt;code&gt;builtins&lt;/code&gt; are, and why you should use them instead of general commands, whenever you can. There is a section that shortly goes through the process of even creating one ourselves. But that should &lt;strong&gt;not be considered to be a tutorial&lt;/strong&gt;. This article won&amp;rsquo;t teach you how to create a built-ins yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
